**1. What is the importance of influencers in relation to Instagram?**

According to Big Commerce, Influencer marketing is “when companies partner with influencers in order to increase brand awareness or conversions among a specific target audience.[1] ”More than 55% of Gen Z US internet users—who do half of their fashion shopping online—said their most recent fashion purchases were inspired by social media browsing, learning about products from their influencers. [2]


Influencer marketing is growing bigger and bigger. More powerful than traditional ads, IG enable brands to connect with their customers visually as a way of advertising and online marketing. The human factor of influencer marketing is important for businesses to connect with their potential customer. Users can discover more products/ services promoted by the accounts they follow. Influencers are endorsed many ways to promote a business, and the amount of money they are paid is estimated by taking in consideration of their follow counts, engagement rate, project scope, and production costs.[3] IG also established the “paid membership feature” as a solution to increase transparency of sponsored contents. 


IG benefits from influencer marketing because influencers’ popularity and fame attracts more users, keeping the engagement rate relatively high. IG currently doesn’t require influencers to pay the platform itself (I will look at this in the future)While more and more businesses are adopting influencer marketing, and more and more people are becoming influencers, making the market very saturated, there are a lot of mental impacts on those who are working on becoming an influencer. Danielle Leigh Wagstaff, a psychology doctor at Federation University Australia, states that it is human nature to compare oneself to each other in order to figure out where we stand. “She believes that Instagram – more so than any other platform – confuses our social comparison radar. “With Instagram, we have immediate access to all of these idealized images, which aren’t always an accurate representation of the world,” Wagstaff says. “People tend to post only their best images on Instagram, using filters that make them look beautiful. We have a false sense of what the average is, which makes us feel worse about ourselves.” [4]


**2. Instagram is a free app. Other than running advertisements and sponsorship, what other meta economy are there on Instagram?**

Instagram belongs to Facebook and share the same advertisement stream with Facebook. Instagram (IG) is a photo-sharing app, designed focusing on the visual display of content, and communication through visual language is one of the shortest ways to humans understanding. With its nature of being photo based, IG is a perfect environment for advertisement to thrive. Ads on IG can exist under the form of carousel slides or external links on the feed, or on IG story. [5]

Besides advertisement and sponsorship, Instagram don’t make money from any other sources. That’s why IG has to design the interface to maximize user’s exposure to content and their engagement rate. IG targets the photo-centric experience for users, making the photo the center of attention on the feed. The bottomless scrolling feature cultivates the users’ habit of scrolling endlessly, and the longer users stay on their feed/story, the more ads can reach them. [6]

IG is a natural platform for businesses, from small to big, to create a brand and promote their products. IG created the “shopping on Instagram” feature which allow creators to tag their products on the photo, and users can tap on these tags to learn more information about the products, saving these items in the “shopping bag”. Or more simple, in my country Vietnam, most small businesses have IG profile instead of relying on the websites. If they cannot afford creator account, they can list items and the price and details in the caption section, and buyers can message the stores for order and shipping.

Back in 2016-2017, I remember downloading “Follower for Follower” apps on Appstore to gain followers, and then unfollow them. There were also options to buy followers with real money. All of the followers I gained app don’t engage with my contents, the people I have to follow in exchange don’t post any interesting contents, and the follow counts are not sustainable either, so I gave up that idea of gaining fake followers. Now in 2020, Instagram prohibited all “F4F” and ”L4L” apps as they are no longer available on Appstore. [7]
