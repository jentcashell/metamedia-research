**OVERVIEW**

Instagram is an online photo/video sharing and social networking app for smartphones. The app allows users to take and post pictures or short videos and apply filters on them and share them on their feed. Security setting allows users to choose their post to be either public or private. Users can like, comment, share, and save posts. The user interface is minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing, framed in 3 columns of squares that resemble polaroid 1:1 picture ratio, attracting 1 billion users as of May 2019. For posting long videos, Instagram added IGTV which allows posting videos up to 10 minutes. 

With its simple interactive interface, Instagram has become an integral tool for online marketing, helping businesses to promote themselves, and also becomes a marketplace with “Buy on Instagram”. In competition to Snapchat, Instagram added Insta Story which lasts 24 hours which is used by 500 million users daily. By January 2020, Instagram has 1 billion active users. [1]




**IMPORTANT PEOPLE**

Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger are the co-creators of Instagram. Its root was found in Burbn, a mobile check-in app that both of the creators worked on, and since Burbn is too complicated and too similar to Foursquare, they turned to focus on their photo-sharing app and created Instagram (instant camera and telegram).

Kevin Systrom graduated from Stanford with a bachelor’s degree in management science and engineering. While he was working at Google, he learned how to code after work and built an HTML5 prototype called Burbn. The idea of Burbn is based on a combination of location check-ins and popular social games. A turning point was when Systrom attended the Hunch Party and pitched about Burbn, receiving funding from investors from Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz.

Co-founder Mike Krieger was an enthusiast of Burbn, and that’s how they met. They both completed Stanford University’s Mayfield Fellows program which educated them on start-ups and provided them internships with established companies. Krieger had experience as an engineer and UX designer at Meebo. They both agreed on focusing on the photo-sharing function of Burbn and developed it into Instagram. "Our goal is to not just be a photo-sharing app, but to be the way you share your life when you're on the go," Systrom says. 

The initial team consisted of four people Systrom, Krieger, a customer service expert, and another programmer, operated in an old Twitter office in San Francisco.[2][3][4]



**MILESTONES**

In October 2009, Systrom started working on Burbn. In March 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 seed funding while working on Burbn, and in May 2010, Kevin joined the Burbn project. On October 6, 2010, Instagram was launched. In early 2011, Instagram added #hashtags as a way for users to find photographs and other profiles. 

In April 2012, Instagram was sold to Facebook for $1 billion, along with 13 employees. Before that, Instagram released an Android phone version, and later in November, the website version was launched with limited functions. Many more functions were added to Instagram such as videos, messaging, advertising, posting in slides (up to 10 photos/videos). 

In 2016, Instagram changed the interface to a modern black and white flat design theme with colorful icons. In June 2016, Instagram changed its feed algorithm from chronological order to “best” posts first. They added Insta Stories in August 2016 and Live Stories in November 2016. The Insta Stories idea is directly taken from Snapchat with a goal to attract users away from Snapchat.

In 2018, Adam Mosseri, a former Facebook VP of News Feed, became the new CEO of Instagram. The founders decided to resign because they faced tensions with Mark Zuckerberg. In June, IGTV was launched, enabling users to upload videos under 10 minutes in competition against YouTube. 

In October 2019, Instagram removed the Following activity tab where users could see their followed users' likes and comments. Instagram is plotting to remove the like counts for publicly posted contents and only visible for original poster since Mosseri aims to make users "worry a little bit less about how many likes they're getting on Instagram and spend a bit more time connecting with the people that they care about."
