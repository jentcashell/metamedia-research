**1. Good diary**

Today, my account hits 1 million followers. In the beginning, I used IG solely to share my art and discover new artist and inspirations, but I never expected my art to resonate with so many people. My art account has been on Instagram for almost 10 years. I started by posting my art weekly, or maybe monthly.  My account developed drastically, from only 100 followers in 2016 to 1 million followers in 2026. My art can be described as abstract figurative, mix media, and some what high tech. With all the development and almighty tools of IG, I was able to create a visually compelling portfolio for my art. Through Instagram, I came in contact with many amazing artists and galleries curators which helps me promote my art and open exhibitions. I enjoy creating art of people I love and admire, from my family and friends to big influencers and public figures, and sometimes I have the courage of tagging celebrities on my posts. I still remember the day I posted my portrait of Lady Gaga, and luckily she shared my art on her Instagram story, and I received thousands of likes and followings. Some of my fans create art based on my style, and I feel proud to inspire a younger generation of artists. I also opened a shop for my original art, prints, and merchandise, making art making not just a passion but also turned it into a business. However, I will not lose the authenticity of my art and keep doing art with passion and intuition.
